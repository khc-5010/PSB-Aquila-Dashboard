# CLAUDE.md - Project Context

## Project Overview

PSB-Aquila Opportunity Tracker is a Kanban-style pipeline management tool for tracking university-industry partnership opportunities between Penn State Behrend (PSB) and Aquila. Three users (Kyle, Duane, Steve) use it to manage opportunities from initial lead through active project engagement.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Neon (PostgreSQL)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Language:** JavaScript (TypeScript migration planned)

```

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build            # Production build
npm run preview          # Preview production build locally

# Database
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client (if using Prisma)
npx prisma db push       # Push schema to Neon
npx prisma studio        # Open database GUI

# Deployment
vercel                   # Deploy to Vercel (preview)
vercel --prod            # Deploy to production
```

## Code Conventions

- **Components:** Functional components with hooks only (no class components)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS exclusively—no separate CSS files or CSS-in-JS
- **Component size:** Keep components small and focused (<100 lines preferred)
- **State:** Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local state; Context for shared state
- **Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Files:** One component per file, filename matches component name
- **Imports:** Group by: React → external libs → internal absolute → relative

## Domain Context

### What This Tracks

Partnership opportunities for the **Industrial AI Alliance**—a collaboration between PSB (university), Aquila (AI company), and Industry Partners. Each opportunity represents a potential project with a company.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Lead** - Initial contact or interest identified
2. **Qualified** - Confirmed fit, scope being discussed
3. **Proposal** - Formal proposal submitted
4. **Negotiation** - Contract/terms being finalized
5. **Active** - Project in progress
6. **Complete** - Project delivered (archive)

### Project Types & Stakeholder Routing

| Project Type | Primary PSB Contact | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Research Agreement** | Alicyn Rhoades (VC Research), Jennifer Surrena (contracts) | 4-6 week processing time |
| **Senior Design / Capstone** | Dean Lewis (dal16@psu.edu) | **Aug 15 deadline** for fall semester |
| **Consulting Engagement** | Aquila-led | Amy Bridger for partnership structure |
| **Workforce Training** | TBD | Program-specific routing |
| **Alliance Membership** | Amy Bridger | Revenue model discussions |
| **Does Not Fit** | N/A | Archive with reason |

### Critical Constraints

- **Research agreements:** 4-6 week minimum processing time
- **Senior Design deadline:** August 15 for fall semester placement
- **Winter shutdown:** ~Dec 20 - Jan 6, no contract processing
- **Communication Matrix:** Defines full routing logic (see project files when available)

### Key Stakeholders

- **Kyle, Duane, Steve** - Primary users managing the pipeline
- **Alicyn Rhoades** - PSB Vice Chancellor for Research
- **Jennifer Surrena** - PSB Contracts
- **Dean Lewis** - Senior Design coordinator (dal16@psu.edu)
- **Amy Bridger** - Partnership structure & alliance membership

## Database Schema

*To be defined. Will include:*

- `opportunities` - Main tracking table (company, type, stage, owner, dates)
- `activities` - Activity log / notes per opportunity
- `stakeholders` - Contact information and routing rules
- `deadlines` - Critical dates and automated alerts

## Keeping This File Current

This file is only useful if it stays accurate. Maintain it actively:

- **Architectural decisions**: When we make a significant decision (tech choice, pattern, convention), update this file immediately
- **New commands/scripts**: When adding build scripts, dev commands, or utilities, add them to Key Commands
- **Recurring issues**: When we hit the same problem twice, add guidance here so we don't repeat it
- **Schema changes**: When database tables or columns change, update the Database Schema section
- **New conventions**: When a coding pattern emerges that we want to keep consistent, document it

**Proactive updates**: When something feels like it should be documented, ask "Should I add this to CLAUDE.md?" Don't wait to be asked.

## Environment Variables

```
DATABASE_URL=            # Neon PostgreSQL connection string
VITE_API_URL=            # API base URL (if separate backend)
```

## Notes

- This is a small team tool (3 users), optimize for simplicity over scale
- Mobile-friendly but desktop-primary usage expected
- Focus on visibility and reducing dropped balls in the pipeline
